# Full Stack Disaster Recovery Cloud Service Samples

Full Stack Disaster Recovery (FSDR) is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) disaster recovery orchestration and management service that provides comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities for all layers of an application stack, including infrastructure, middleware, database, and application.

This repository contains code samples related to Full Stack Disaster Recovery Cloud Service from Oracle.

## Installation and Usage

Download the scripts and copy them to the OCI Compute instance where you want to execute these scripts.

Run the script using the command syntax: python <script_name> <script_arguments>
  
Here is a sample command:
  
<i> /usr/bin/python3 /home/opc/fsdr/fullstackdr_script_executor.py local --mode execute --script_interpreter '/bin/sh' --script_path '/home/opc/fsdr/my_custom_script.sh' --script_arguments  'FSDR1 FSDR2' </i>

In the above sample command, we are assuming that the scripts are available in the folder named /home/opc/fsdr on the compute instance.  The <i> my_custom_script.sh </i> is the user defined script that the user wants to execute.
